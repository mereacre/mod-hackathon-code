This collection of files requires the list of routes, with each roue contained within a json file. 

The data can then be extracted into indvidual .mat files using the IspectData file, then sorted using the SavRelevantData ile. 

After this the traffic map can be created using the Create2Dhist.m file.

The other file Create2DhistUpsample.m upsamples and interpolates the data based on the speed to generate a similiar map.
